# Reminders

This is just a simple list of things that peaked my interest
in terms of nix, nixos, or nixpkgs. It'll contain links to
anything that i want to do but am too lazy to actually implement
or use my brain on.

## Caddy plugins

It seems there's a lot of 
[discourse around caddy plugin packaging](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/89268#issuecomment-636529668).
This looks like a caddy package that includes the plugins in the
build process of caddy. I want to tinker around with the
[layer 4](https://github.com/mholt/caddy-l4) plugin, so something
like this might be needed in the future?
